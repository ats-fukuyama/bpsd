Mixed Bohm/gyro-Bohm model 1.0

The Mixed Bohm/gyro-Bohm anomalous transport model (also called the JET
or JETTO transport model) contains Bohm and gyro-Bohm contributions.
The Bohm contribution, which is linear in the gyro-radius, is a 
non-local transport model, in which the transport throughout the plasma
depends on a finite difference approximation to the electron temperature
gradient at the edge of the plasma.  The gyro-Bohm contribution is a
local transport model, which is proportional to the square of the
gyro-radius.  The version of the Mixed Bohm/gyro-Bohm model in this
module is described in detail in Nuclear Fusion 38 (1998) 1013.
The magnetic and flow shear stabilization are described in Plasma
Physics and Controlled Fusion 44 (2002) A495.

Files
------------------------------------------------------------------------

From the tarred/zipped files you should get the directory structure:

  \mixed_model     -main directory plus configure and make files
    \bin           -binaries
    \data          -input and reference output file
    \doc           -documentation
    \lib           -libraries
    \source        -source code

Mixed Bohm/gyro-Bohm model on a UNIX system
------------------------------------------------------------------------

On a UNIX system you can configure the makefile with the command:

./configure 

The mixed Bohm/gyro-Bohm model does not require any additioanl libraries, 
except the standard Fortran-90 libraries

Then 'make' can be run with the following options:

make doc        to create documentation tex files in the subdirectory ./doc
make compile    to compile the source files and to build the drive program
make run        to run the drive program and compare the results with the
                reference case. The comparison results can be found in the
		file ./data/output.diff. The file output.diff has zero size 
                if the code is running correctly and there are no differences
		there are no differences.
make clean      to remove *.o, *.mod files
make realclean  to remove *.o, *.mod plus library and binary files
