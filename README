*********************************************************
***** TASK : Transport Analyzing System for tokamaK *****
*********************************************************

System Requirements:
       UNIX or UNIX-like system (including Linux, MacOSX)
       Fortran77 compiler (g77, pgf77, ifort, xlf, ...)
       X-Window library
       GSAF graphic library
          usually distributed with TASK
          http://p-grp.nucleng.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~fukuyama/gsaf/

Optional Libraries:
          Lapack    Linear algebra library 
                        http://www.netlib.org/
          MPI       Parallel processing library
                        for example, MPICH implementation
                        http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich/
          MDSplus   Scientific data base library
                        http://www.mdsplus.org/

Present modules:
    pl: Module interface library
    eq: 2D equilibrium module (fixed boundary)
    tr: 1D transport module (diffusive transport)
    wr: 3D ray tracing module
    wm: 3D full wave module
    dp: Wave dispersion module
    fp: 3D Fokker Planck module (*)
    tot: all-in-one program
    lib: common libraries
    mtx: common matrix libraries
    mpi: interface 
    TOOLS: various tools to handle ufile

    (*) Under reconstruction at present.  
        Several limitations in the function.

Install: 
    0: Install GSAF graphic library, Before installing TASK
    1: Expand tar.gz file
          tar xvzf taskXXX.tar.gz               [gnu tar]
          gzcat taskXXX.tar.gz | tar xvf -      [tar]
    2: Move to task directory
          mv task
    3: Create make.header
          cp make.header.org make.header
    4: Edit make.header
          Remove "#" of the first column of section
          appropriate for your system.
          Set the location of graphic libraries.
          If you have Lapack library, change "#"s.
          If you have MDSplus library, change "#"s.
    5: Move to appropriate module directory
          cd eq [for example]
    6: Make a module
          make
    7: Execute the module
          ./eq [for example]

Update:
    If you change a source file in the present module, 
        "make" again.
    If you change a source file in the other module, 
        you may need to "make libs"
    If you change settings in a Makefile or make.header, 
        you need to "make clean" and "make" again.

Standard input command:
    V: view input parameters
    R: run the calculation
    C: continue the calculation
    G: graphic mode
         commands in graphic mode (see documents of the module)
         X: exit graphic command
    S: save present calculation data
    L: load saved calculation data
    Q: quit execution

Input parameters:
    1. Definitions and default values of input parameters are
       described in XXinit.f.  Most of common input parameters 
       are given in pl/plinit.f.  We do not recommend you to 
       modify XXinit.f.  You had better to use XXparm file 
       described in the next item instead.
    2. You can set standard input parameters in a text file 
       XXparm located at the working directory.  The format
       of XXparm file is the fortran namelist input.
    3. You can change the input parameters on the input command 
       line.  A input line including a character "=", e.g. 
       "RR=6.2" is recognized as a part of namelist input.

Compile parameters:
       The size of arrays are usually defined in XXcom0.inc.
       For large scale calculation, you may need to increase 
       the numbers in XXcom0.inc and "make" again.
