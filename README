***** TASK : Transport Analyzing System for tokamaK *****
*********************************************************

2009/02/15
   Major update of fp:
      Parallel processing using PETSc library
      Large number of radial grid points
      Radial diffusion model included
      Fusion reaction rate can be calculated from f.
   mtxp directory added:
      Interface for PETSc library
      This will replace mtx in near future
   plx directory added:
      Fortran 90 version of pl
      This will replace pl in near future
   PETSc library can be downloaded from
      http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/
   To use PETSs library
      Install mpi or mpi2
      Install PETSc library
      Change mtxp/Makefile to use PETSc
      make in mtxp
      Change fp/Makefile to use PETSc
      make in fp

2008/01/27: 
   Directory bpsd is required at the same directory level with task.
   If you are using CVS, "cvs co bpsd" in the directory 
   including the task directory. 

   make.header.org was updated. 
   You have to copy make.header.org to make.header and 
   remove comment # of a required compiler group.

   mod directories will be created in several components 
   in order to store module information files.

-------

System Requirements:
       UNIX or UNIX-like system (including Linux, MacOSX)
       Fortran95 compiler with extention (g95, pgf95, ifort, xlf, ...)
       X-Window library
       GSAF graphic library
          usually distributed with TASK
          http://p-grp.nucleng.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~fukuyama/gsaf/

Optional Libraries:
          Lapack    Linear algebra library

          MPI       Parallel processing library
                        for example, MPICH implementation
                        http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich/
          MDSplus   Scientific data base library
                        http://www.mdsplus.org/

Present modules:
    pl: Module interface library (*)
    eq: 2D equilibrium module (fixed boundary)
    tr: 1D transport module (diffusive transport)
    wr: 3D ray tracing module
    wm: 3D full wave module
    dp: Wave dispersion module
    fp: 3D Fokker Planck module
    tot: all-in-one program
    lib: common libraries
    mtx: common matrix libraries
    mpi: interface 
    TOOLS: various tools to handle ufile

    (*)   Module interfaces are not completed in the present version.

Install: 
    0: Install GSAF graphic library, Before installing TASK
          tar xvzf gsafXXX.tar.gz
          Follow README
    1: Expand tar.gz file
          tar xvzf taskXXX.tar.gz
          tar xvzf bpsdXXX.tar.gz
    2: Move to task directory
          cd task
    3: Create make.header
          cp make.header.org make.header
    4: Edit make.header
          Remove "#" of the first column of section
          appropriate for your system.
          Set the location of graphic libraries.
          If you have Lapack library, change "#"s.
          If you have MDSplus library, change "#"s.
    5: Make common library
          cd lib
          make
          cd ..
    6: Make bpsd library
          cd ../bpsd
          make
          cd ../task
    7: Make appropriate module
          cd tot [for example]
          make
          ./tot [for example]

Update:
    If you change a source file in the present module, 
        "make" again.
    If you change a source file in the other module, 
        you need to "make libs"
    If you change settings in a Makefile or make.header, 
        you need to "make clean" and "make" again.

Standard input command:
    V: view input parameters
    R: run the calculation
    C: continue the calculation
    G: graphic mode
         commands in graphic mode (see documents of the module)
         X: exit graphic command
    S: save present calculation data
    L: load saved calculation data
    Q: quit execution

Input parameters:
    1. Definitions and default values of input parameters are
       described in XXinit.f.  Most of common input parameters 
       are given in pl/plinit.f.  We do not recommend you to 
       modify XXinit.f.  You had better to use XXparm file 
       described in the next item instead.
    2. You can set standard input parameters in a text file 
       XXparm located at the working directory.  The format
       of XXparm file is the fortran namelist input.
    3. You can change the input parameters on the input command 
       line.  A input line including a character "=", e.g. 
       "RR=6.2", is recognized as a part of namelist input.

Compile parameters:
       The size of arrays are usually defined in XXcom0.inc.
       For large scale calculation, you may need to increase 
       the numbers in XXcom0.inc and "make" again.
